# Demand-sale-Forecasting-ML-Model using Prophet Model


## Project Overview
•	Objective: Predict future sales demand based on past sales, seasonality, and promotions.
•	Tools: Python (pandas, statsmodels, scikit-learn, Prophet), SQL for data extraction, Flask/FastAPI for deployment, and cloud options like AWS/GCP/Azure for production.


# Project Roadmap
1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
•	Load historical sales data from SQL or CSV.
•	Handle missing values, outliers, and feature engineering (seasonality, holidays, promotions).
•	Train-test split.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
•	Analyze trends, seasonality, and promotional impact.
•	Visualize using seaborn, matplotlib, and Plotly.

3. Model Building
•	Machine Learning: Random Forest, XGBoost for forecasting.
•	Deep Learning (Optional): LSTMs if needed.
•	Prophet Model: Facebook's Prophet for easy handling of holidays and seasonality.

4. Model Evaluation
•	Use RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and R² for performance evaluation.

5. Deployment
•	Build an API using Flask/FastAPI.
•	Deploy on AWS Lambda/Azure Functions/GCP Cloud Run.
•	Integrate with a web app or Power BI dashboard.
